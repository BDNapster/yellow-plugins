How to use a contact page?
--------------------------
The contact page is available on your website as `http://website/contact/`. You can add a link to your navigation or individual pages. An email address can be defined in the meta data of the page, for example `Email: user@user.com`. There's a spam filter which you can adjust to block unwanted advertising.

The template does not work with static websites, it needs a Yellow installation.
