The Yellow documentation is **for web designers and developers**. It will help you making websites with [Yellow](https://github.com/markseu/yellowcms).

Overview

Yellow is a CMS (Content Management System) for people who make websites. Personal blog or company website, create anything you like. Yellow is file-based, everything is made of files and folders. You can edit pages online in a web browser. Once you're done you can build static pages that don't need a CMS anymore.
