Yellow documentation
====================

[Yellow](https://github.com/markseu/yellowcms) is a CMS **for people** who make websites. The documentation is here to help you.

Overview
--------
Personal blog or company website, create anything you like. Yellow is file-based, everything is made of files and folders. You can edit pages in a web browser or in your text editor. Once you're done you can build static pages that don't need Yellow anymore.
