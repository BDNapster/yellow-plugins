System configuration
====================
All configuration is located in the **system folder**. You can change your website settings here.

The `config` folder contains configuration files. The `core` folder is for the Yellow software itself. The `plugins` folder is for additional Yellow features. Most configuration happens in the `snippets` and `templates` folders, this is where the website functionality is defined. The `themes` stores the visual design of your website.

Changes in system folders affect the entire website.

Configuration
-------------
The main configuration file is `system/config/config.ini`. You can define the default settings of your website here. For a new installation you should set sitename, author and language. Here's an example:

    sitename = Anna's Design Company
    author = Anna Svensson
    language = en
    theme = default
    template = default

These settings can also be overwritten in the individual settings of a page. All files should be stored in [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

Themes
------
The visual design of pages is defined with themes. There's a default theme for the entire website. A different theme can be defined in the settings of a page, for example `Theme: popular` uses the style sheet `system/themes/popular.css`. Otherwise, the default theme or the name of the folder is used. 

Start with a theme that you like. There are [themes](https://github.com/markseu/yellowcms-extensions/tree/master/themes) you can download.

Templates
---------
The output of pages is controlled with templates. There's a default template for the entire website. A different template can be defined in the settings of a page, for example `Template: blog` uses the file `system/templates/blog.php`. Otherwise, the default template or the name of the folder is used. Templates can generate web pages and other formats. Here's an example:

    <?php $yellow->snippet("header") ?>
    <?php $yellow->snippet("sitename") ?>
    <?php $yellow->snippet("navigation") ?>
    <?php $yellow->snippet("content") ?>
    <?php $yellow->snippet("footer") ?>

Write your own templates. There are [templates](https://github.com/markseu/yellowcms-extensions/tree/master/templates) you can download.

Snippets
--------
Snippets are pieces of code. They allow to re-use the same code in multiple templates:

    <?php $yellow->snippet("navigation") ?>

You can pass arguments to snippets:

    <?php $yellow->snippet("example", $argument1, $argument2) ?>

Have a look at some of the existing snippets. There are [snippets](https://github.com/markseu/yellowcms-extensions/tree/master/snippets) you can download.

Error handling
--------------
Yellow will tell you when something goes wrong. For example a missing file shows "File not found" with corresponding [HTTP status code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). The file `system/config/error404.txt` defines how a missing file looks like. You have complete control over what's shown to visitors. Check the web server logfile for further information.
