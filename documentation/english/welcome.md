Welcome to Yellow
=================
Yellow is for people who make websites. You can create web pages, blogs and wikis. The focus is on people, a great user experience and that it's useful for your website. It's quick to install and quick to update a website. Yellow adds modern features to make writing web pages more secure and more fun.

Yellow is a flat-file content management system. Everything is just files and folders. There's no database, no admin panel, no template engine, no upload manager, no complete framework. Most websites do not need all of these features. Let's focus on the essentials and make tools to work better together. Use all your favourite tools.

Web browser
-----------
One way to edit your website is the web browser. Click the edit link on a page. You can also open your website and append 'edit' to the address bar. For example `http://website/edit/`. It's a great way to update your website. You can use the normal website navigation, make some changes and see the results immediately.

File manager
------------
Another way to edit your website is the file manager. You can edit pages in your favorite text editor. You don't need to learn another software, you just take one that you already know. Experienced users can use the command line, for example to build static pages and automate things.

Not much to learn
-----------------
Start by editing your website. If you have to read all the documentation first, then we have done something wrong. The Yellow documentation is for people who want to make websites. With this documentation you should get a good understanding of how your website works. We can’t wait to see what you create.
