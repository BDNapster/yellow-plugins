Welcome to Yellow
=================
Create small web pages, blogs and wikis. The focus is on people, a great user experience and that it's useful for your website. No database, no admin panel, no template engine, no upload manager, no complete framework. Most people don't need all of these features. Let's concentrate on the essential aspects and tools that work together.

Yellow is for people who make websites. [Download](https://github.com/markseu/yellowcms/archive/master.zip) and [demo](http://demo.datenstrom.se/).

Web browser
-----------
One way to edit your website is the web browser. Click the edit link on a page. You can also open your website and append 'edit' to the address bar. For example `http://website/edit/`. It's a great way to update your website. You can use the normal website navigation, make some changes and see the results immediately.

File manager
------------
Another way to edit your website is the file manager. Everything is just files and folders. You can edit pages in your favorite text editor. You don't need to learn another editing software. Take one that you already know. Experienced users can use the command line, for example to build static pages and automate things.

Not much to learn
-----------------
Start by editing your website. Just give it a try. If you have to read the whole documentation first, then we have done something wrong. The Yellow documentation gives you more information and a good understanding of how your website works. We can’t wait to see what you create.
